            I'm a software engineer and full-stack web developer who's passionate about UI design and building applications that are appealing to users. As a child I would desgin whole worlds for my imagination to florish either through drawing, Lego building,
            acting, and even some stop-motion animation. Today I apply my creative energy towards coding and game tinkering. 
            <br/>
            If I find a game I really enjoy, I think of ways I could modify and change some asepcts of it; like adding new rules or mechanics.
            It's always a fun puzzle to work out, trying to get the new rules I design to work with the preexisting rules of the game
